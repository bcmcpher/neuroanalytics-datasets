# Zettelkaten - Making a second brain

## Overview

The Zettelkasten Method is a **holistic method on how to deal with
knowledge**. It is defined as a **personal tool for thinking and
writing** that possesses hypertextual features to enable the creation
of a **web of thoughts**.

The method emphasizes **connection, not collection**. It is considered
highly effective and acts as an **amplifier** of endeavors in
knowledge work. With consistent effort and practice, it can produce
"gems of knowledge". The method helps streamline workflow, decrease
friction, and makes writing easier and more coherent by holding
thoughts alive over long periods.

The method is based on the work of the highly productive social
scientist, **Niklas Luhmann**, who published 50 books and over 600
articles. Luhmann himself attributed his output to working in a
partnership with his Zettelkasten.

### Core Principles of the Zettelkasten Method

The Zettelkasten Method is founded on three primary traits:

#### 1. Hyper-textual Structure
The Zettelkasten is a type of hypertext where notes refer to, explain,
expand upon, and use each other's information. This structure is
**organic and non-linear**.

*   **Connectivity:** The emphasis on forming relationships between
	pieces of knowledge makes new **insights possible**, as insights
	result from making unexpected connections.
*   **Link Context:** When connecting notes, it is essential to
	explicitly state **why** the connection was made, which is called
	the *link context*. This ensures the meaning of the link is
	captured and creates new knowledge.

#### 2. Principle of Atomicity
This principle dictates that knowledge is composed of **discrete
building blocks**. The guiding compass for note-taking is to capture
**one knowledge building block, or precisely one thought, per note**.

*   **Contrast with Other Systems:** This contrasts with systems like
	books or Wikipedia articles, where references (chapters, pages)
	serve only as coordinates and do not directly correspond to a
	single, referenceable thought.

#### 3. Personal Focus
The Zettelkasten is intended to be a **personal thinking tool**;
therefore, the guideline is one Zettelkasten per person. Writing in
the $Zettelkasten$ should be done for oneself, unlike writing for the
public.

### The Anatomy of a Note ($Zettel$)

An individual note, or $Zettel$ (German for "paper slip"), is the
smallest building block of the system. Every $Zettel$ must have three
components:

1.  **A Unique Identifier (ID):** This is the unambiguous **address**
	of the note, mandatory for creating the hypertext.
	*   **Luhmann-ID:** For paper systems, Luhmann used a clever
		branching numbering system (e.g., $1$, $2$, $1a$, $1b$, $1a1$)
		to allow **organic growth** by interspersing or continuing
		trains of thought.
	*   **Digital IDs:** Digital systems often use a **time-based ID**
		(e.g., $202006110955$) or an arbitrary unique string.

2.  **The Body of the $Zettel$:** This contains the piece of knowledge
	to be captured. The most important aspect is that the content must
	be written **in the note taker's own words** to increase
	understanding and recall.

3.  **References:** Located at the bottom of the $Zettel$, this
	section references the sources of the knowledge.
	*   References to external sources (like books or articles)
		typically use **citekeys** from reference management software.
	*   If the note is based on material already processed, it
		references other **$Zettel$s by linking to their ID**.
	*   If no reference is provided, the content is considered the
		note taker's **own thought by default**.

### Adding Structure to the Zettelkasten

While the method emphasizes bottom-up creation through individual
$Zettel$s and connections, hierarchical organization is also useful
via **Structure Notes**.

*   **Structure Notes (Meta-Notes):** These are $Zettel$s that list
	many other $Zettel$s and their relationships on a specific topic,
	serving as "hub notes" or tables of contents.
*   **Entry Points:** Luhmann utilized a **register** that listed
	keywords with only one or a few note IDs, serving solely as entry
	points to the most central clusters of notes in his paper-based
	hypertext.
*   **Semilattice Structure:** The overlaps in how different Structure
	Notes reference the same $Zettel$s create a **semilattice
	structure** that captures complex relationships better than a
	simple tree structure.

## Creating a Second Brain

The process is sometimes referred to as creating a "second brain"
because the core methods involved, particularly the Zettelkasten
Method and modern AI-driven tools, function as an **external amplifier
for human thinking, knowledge storage, and connectivity**.

### Zettelkasten Method as a Personal Thinking Tool

The Zettelkasten Method is explicitly defined as a **personal tool for
thinking and writing**. It is designed to act as an amplifier of
endeavors in knowledge work.

The term "second brain" relates to how the Zettelkasten handles
functions typically associated with the human mind:

*   **Holding Thoughts Alive (Persistence):** One of the main problems
	in writing and thinking is the human brain's limited capacity to
	follow a single line of thought for an extended period, such as
	weeks or months. The Zettelkasten solves this by acting as an
	external memory system that **will hold your thoughts alive and
	help you hold onto them**.
*   **Facilitating Complex Reasoning:** The method allows individuals
	working on complex problems to concentrate on a small part of the
	problem and then step back to view it with a **panorama vision**,
	suggesting it manages the complexity that the limited human mind
	struggles to juggle.
*   **Generating Insights via Connectivity:** Insights often arise
	from making new (and unexpected) connections. The Zettelkasten
	focuses on **connection, not collection**, creating a **web of
	thoughts** via its hypertextual structure. This structure allows
	the user's mind to outsource the maintenance of relationships
	between pieces of knowledge, which significantly **improves
	recall** and trains the mind to **see patterns**.
*   **Personalized Knowledge:** The rule that there should be **one
	Zettelkasten per person** reinforces the concept of a personal,
	external organ for thought, as the content is written for oneself
	and not for the public, avoiding the distortion that comes from
	filtering one's thoughts for others.

### Modern AI Tools as "Second Brains"

The concept extends to modern tools like **NotebookLM**, which
similarly manage and synthesize information to aid deeper
understanding:

*   **Research Assistant Functionality:** NotebookLM is designed to be
	a **virtual note-taking and research assistant**. Steven Johnson,
	who worked on the NotebookLM team, explained that it is a tool for
	understanding things, taking information, digesting it, and
	analyzing it so the user can **glean more from it**.
*   **Centralizing Scattered Information:** The tool addresses the
	problem where information needed for a project is **scattered
	across desktop folders, tabs, and other places**. By consolidating
	up to 50 sources (PDFs, Google Docs, websites, videos, etc.) and
	up to 25 million words into individual notebooks, the platform
	takes on the burden of **managing, connecting, and synthesizing
	information**.
*   **Personalized AI:** By keeping related sources in a single
	notebook (such as an "everything notebook" or a project-based
	notebook), the user effectively gains a **personalized AI that is
	almost like having another member of the team**. This external
	resource can then be instructed to synthesize information, draft
	outlines, or connect dots between materials.

## Obsidian

Obsidian is fundamentally a **note-making application** (or "note app") that users download and install on their computer. It allows users to create notes within a designated folder called a **vault**.

Key characteristics and functions of Obsidian include:

*   **Focus on Plain Text:** Obsidian uses **Markdown ($\mathrm{md}$) files** for its notes. Markdown is a plain text format, which is highly versatile and durable, meaning the notes are "future-proof" and readable by any computer.
*   **Connecting Ideas (Hypertext):** Obsidian's core purpose is to help users move **from consuming content to connecting ideas**. This is done primarily through **links**, which are created by enclosing a note's title in double brackets (e.g., `[[Note Title]]`). These links turn the collection of notes into an **idea verse**â€”a well-connected "internet for the inner world".
*   **The Second Brain/Thinking Tool:** By linking thoughts together, Obsidian facilitates **linking your thinking**, which helps grow and cultivate thoughts over time. It functions as a **personal knowledge management** library, designed for **writing and thinking**.
*   **Viewing Relationships:** The application features a **graph view** where users can visualize all the connections they have made between their notes.
*   **Note Integrity:** Obsidian has a crucial setting that automatically updates internal links if a note's name is changed, ensuring that the relationships between notes remain intact.
*   **Structure and Tags:** Users can structure their notes using **headers** (Markdown `#` symbols) and apply **tags** (using `#` symbols) to create weak relationship builders for categorization.
*   **Data Source Integration:** The Markdown files created in Obsidian can be used as a data source for LLM applications that utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

### Getting Started

The Zettelkasten Method, implemented within the Markdown-based
environment of Obsidian, provides a powerful structure for tracking
the iterative progress, technical methodologies, and core findings of
a data science project. By emphasizing **atomicity** and
**connection**, this process transforms raw notes into a dynamic "idea
verse".

Here is a process for getting started with Obsidian to track the
elements of a data science project:

#### Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (The Vault)

The initial setup focuses on ensuring that the knowledge base is
durable, flexible, and ready for growth.

1.  **Create an Obsidian Vault:** Start by creating a new vault, which
	is simply a folder that Obsidian monitors.
2.  **Adopt Plain Text Philosophy:** Ensure all documentation is
	written in **Markdown (`.md`)** files. This plain text approach is
	considered the most versatile and durable file format, making the
	information "future-proof",, and easily manageable by other
	literate programming tools like Git.
3.  **Prioritize Linking over Folders:** When first starting, focus on
	**connecting ideas** rather than rigidly organizing notes into
	hierarchical folders,. Complex organization tends to make the
	system fragile.

#### Phase 2: Atomic Capture of Project Components

The core principle applied here is the **Principle of Atomicity**,
where each note (or $Zettel$) captures one distinct building block of
knowledge. For a data science project, this means capturing tools,
methods, and findings separately.

| Component Type | Action | Example Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tools & Libraries** | Create a note for every tool, library, or platform used (e.g., `Ollama`, `LangChain`, `PubMed Meta Analyzer`). Capture its purpose in your **own words**. | `[[PubMed Meta Analyzer]]`,: A Python tool designed to automate literature reviews by extracting metadata from PubMed via the Entrez API,. |
| **Methods & Concepts** | Create atomic notes for technical concepts or modeling approaches, such as `Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)`, `Transfer Learning`, or `Vector Similarity`. | `[[Hashing-Based Similarity Search]]`: A technique used to enhance search capabilities in evidence retrieval, like topology-preserving hashing. |
| **Findings & Claims** | Create specific notes capturing key project results, crucial data insights, or notable limitations (e.g., observations of `Hallucination Rate` or `Reference Accuracy`). | `[[LLM Context Length Limitations]]`: RAG models struggle with context length in extended queries and difficulties in maintaining context for precise vector similarity searches,. |
| **Source Tracking** | Always include **References** at the bottom of the $Zettel$ (note) identifying the source of external knowledge. For academic work, use **citekeys** from reference management software (e.g., BibDesk or JabRef),. | `References: [#Brown_et_al_2020]` |

#### Phase 3: Connecting and Contextualizing Knowledge

The goal of the Zettelkasten is to build an **organic web of
thoughts** that improves recall and fosters new insights,,.

1.  **Use Internal Hyperlinks for Strong Connections:**
	*   Whenever one idea informs another, create a link using the
		double bracket syntax: `[[Note ID or Title]]`,.
	*   **Capture the Link Context:** When creating a link, explicitly
		state **why** the connection was made, as this is how new
		knowledge is created,. Use the note-making prompt: **"This
		reminds me of..."**,.
	*   *Example:* In a note on `Data Annotation`, use the prompt
		"This reminds me of..." and link it to `[[Active Learning]]`
		because active learning improves biomedical abstract screening
		efficiency.

2.  **Use Tags for Categorization and Metadata:**
	*   Use hashtags (`#`) to create non-hierarchical groups that
		describe the state, component, or category of the
		information,.
	*   *Examples:* `#data_cleaning`, `#model_training`,
		`#evaluation_metrics`, `#python_code`. You can easily check
		all notes containing a tag using the enabled Tag Pane feature
		in Obsidian.

3.  **Manage Progress and Iterations with Git:**
	*   Although Obsidian is not Git, because the notes are Markdown
		files, store the entire vault in a Git repository. This
		ensures **persistence** and provides full **version history**
		for every iteration and insight captured.

#### Phase 4: Structuring the Project (Structure Notes)

To manage complexity and facilitate project writing, organize related
atomic notes into "hub notes".

1.  **Create Project Structure Notes:** Make new notes that act as
	**tables of content** for major project phases or domains. Use a
	Markdown list structure to link related $Zettel$s:
	*   *Example Structure Note: `[[Evaluation Metrics for LLMs]]`*
		*   Metrics for quality: `[[Overall Quality Score (OQS)]]`
		*   Metrics for retrieval: `[[BM25 and TF-IDF]]`
		*   Metrics for accuracy: `[[Hallucination Rate]]`
2.  **Use Structure Notes for Reasoning Chains:** For tracking
	methodology or logical arguments (like systematic review steps),
	create a sequential Structure Note to capture the argument flow
	(e.g., $a \rightarrow b \rightarrow c$) and link to the $Zettel$
	that supports each step,. This provides **panorama vision** over
	complex problems.

#### Phase 5: Technical Maintenance and Integration

Ensure the platform supports the fluid workflow of a data science
project:

1.  **Ensure Link Integrity:** In Obsidian's settings, enable the most
	important setting: **"Automatically update internal links"**. This
	ensures that if you rename a note (like changing `Note Star` to
	`Note Star 2`), all links referring to it automatically update,
	maintaining the functionality of the hypertext.
2.  **Integrate with External Tools (Implicitly):** Use the plain text
	notes as context for advanced LLM analysis. Obsidian notes can be
	used as a source for tools like LlamaIndex when building **Agentic
	Workflows** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These
	agents can then synthesize drafts or outlines using the connected
	thoughts recorded in the Zettelkasten,â€“.
3.  **Focus on Creation:** When working, remember the final goal is
	not organizational perfection but continuous **thinking, writing,
	and connecting ideas**.,
