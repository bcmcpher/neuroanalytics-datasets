## Background

I graduated from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, with a BSc
(Hons) in Electronic and Telecommunications engineering. My honours
project focused on applying deep-learning techniques to identify
patterns in brain waves. Due to my interest in medical imaging, I
pursued a PhD at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, where I
developed image-processing techniques to analyse large-scale coronary
microscopy images. As a postdoctoral fellow at the MIP lab, I am
researching causal models to explain, interpret, and generalize
medical data.
