# [DANDI](https://www.dandiarchive.org/)

The DANDI platform is supported by the BRAIN Initiative for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data. The archive accepts cellular neurophysiology data including electrophysiology, optophysiology, and behavioral time-series, and images from immunostaining experiments. The platform is now available for data upload and distribution. The storage of data in the archive is also supported by the Amazon Opendata program.

## Description

DANDI provides:

1. A cloud-based platform to store, process, and disseminate data. You can use DANDI to collaborate and publish datasets.
2. Open access to data to enable secondary uses of data outside the intent of the study.
3. Optimize data storage and access through partnerships, compression and accessibility technologies.
4. Enables reproducible practices and publications through data standards such as NWB and BIDS, which provide extensive metadata.
5. The platform is not just an endpoint to dump data, it is intended as a living repository that enables collaboration within and across labs, and for others, the entry point for research.

### A FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data archive to house standardized neurophysiology and associated data.

### Rich metadata to support search across data.

### Consistent and transparent data standards to simplify data reuse and software development.

We use the Neurodata Without Borders, Brain Imaging Data Structure, Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM), and other BRAIN Initiative standards to organize and search the data. See Data Standards for more information.

### The data can be accessed programmatically allowing for software to work directly with data in the cloud.

### The infrastructure is built on a software stack of open source products, thus enriching the ecosystem.
