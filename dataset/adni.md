# [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative - ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/)

## Description

The ADNI study actively supports the investigation and development of treatments that slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Researchers at over 60 clinical sites in the USA and Canada collect data to study the progression of AD in the human brain across normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.

### Improve how doctors diagnose patients with Alzheimer's disease

The ADNI study tracks the progression of the disease using biological markers (biomarkers; for example, chemicals found in blood, or changes to the brain observed in MRI and PET scans), together with clinical measures (cognitive and neuropsychological tests), to assess the brain’s structure and function over the course of three disease states (cognitively normal/unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, dementia). ADNI provides study data and biospecimens (samples) to qualified researchers worldwide.

### Provide data to researchers around the world

By studying brain aging in older adults and sharing the knowledge we gain, we can move towards earlier diagnosis, better treatments, and an end to Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

## Dataset

This tool provides interactive views of aggregate-level clinical data contributed longitudinally by over 2,500 participants around the U.S. and Canada.
