# Prevent-AD

## Description

The
[PREVENT-AD](https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/prevent-alzheimer-program/)
research group is now releasing data openly with the intention to
contribute to the community’s growing understanding of AD
pathogenesis.

The PREVENT-Alzheimer program wants to recruit 500 participants. Their
contributions will be the key to finding strategies that can slow or
reverse brain changes that may occur in older people who do not suffer
from dementia. Recruitment is currently closed.

PREVENT-Alzheimer means PRe-symptomatic EValuation of Experimental or
Novel Treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. The PREVENT-AD program is
the principal clinical research activity of the Centre for Studies on
Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease, or StoP-AD Centre. The goal of this
program is to study memory and brain changes in healthy people over
the age of 55. While some people in this age group begin to develop
apparent memory problems, many more may have undetected brain changes
that mark the very beginning of the disease long before the onset of
symptoms.

With rapid advances in technology, such as high-resolution brain
scanning methods or the precise examination of brain chemicals, we can
now detect early evidence of brain changes. What’s more, we can likely
track these changes over time. These brain changes are more likely to
occur in individuals who have had either a parent or sibling affected
by AD. This is why we require that our participants have a close
family member affected by the disease.

## The Dataset

The cohort selection process for the PREVENT-AD study, which was
established in 2011, aimed to identify a population enriched for the
risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD).

The goal of the StoP-AD Centre, which developed the cohort, was to
pursue innovative studies in the preclinical, or asymptomatic, phase
of AD.

### Target Population and Screening

The PREVENT-AD cohort included **cognitively normal older
individuals** who were at-risk due to a strong family history of
sporadic AD. This family history is known to increase the risk of AD
dementia by 2- to 3-fold.

Between 2011 and 2017, the screening process involved the following
steps and numbers:
*   **Screening:** More than 1700 persons from the greater Montreal
	area were screened.
*   **On-site Eligibility Visit (EL00):** 692 screened persons
	completed an on-site eligibility visit.
*   **Baseline Visit (BL00):** 426 participants completed a baseline
	visit.
*   **Final Inclusion:** 387 participants were included in the cohort
	for sustained investigation, or 386 participants met criteria for
	sustained investigation.

### Inclusion Criteria

Participants had to meet the following criteria to be included in the
cohort:

1.  **Family History:** Self-reported parental or multiple-sibling
	(two or more) history of Alzheimer-like dementia.
	*   For the diagnosis of "AD-like dementia," investigators used
		either a compelling AD diagnosis from an experienced clinician
		or a structured questionnaire to establish memory or
		concentration issues severe enough to cause disability, with
		insidious onset and gradual progression.
	*   A list notes that 8 participants had only 1 sibling affected
		with AD-like dementia.
2.  **Age:** They needed to be **60 years of age or older**. However,
	individuals aged 55–59 years were eligible if their age was within
	15 years of the age of symptom onset of their youngest-affected
	first-degree relative.
3.  **Education and Study Partner:** A minimum of 6 years of formal
	education was required, and a study partner needed to be available
	to provide information on cognitive status.
4.  **Protocol Compliance:** Participants needed the ability and
	intention to participate in regular visits, sufficient fluency in
	French and/or English, and agreement for periodic donation of
	biofluids (blood and urine) and periodic multimodal assessments
	via MRI and Lumbar Puncture (LP). LP was initially optional but
	became mandatory in 2017 for participation of new individuals.

### Exclusion Criteria and Cognitive Screening

The primary objective of the screening process was to ensure
participants were **cognitively unimpaired (CU)**.

1.  **Initial Screening:** At the eligibility visit, the **Montreal
	Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)** and the **Clinical Dementia Rating
	(CDR)** were administered to rule out cognitive impairment.
2.  **Follow-up Assessment for Impairment:** If an individual scored
	MoCA $\le 26$ or CDR $> 0$, an exhaustive neuropsychological
	evaluation was performed by a clinician. A very small fraction of
	these individuals were still enrolled if the evaluation confirmed
	normal cognition.
3.  **Baseline Confirmation:** At the baseline visit, the **Repeatable
	Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)**
	was performed. Participants whose scores fell below normative
	values also needed to undergo an exhaustive neuropsychological
	evaluation to confirm normal cognition, otherwise they were
	excluded.
4.  **Exclusions During Phase 1 Follow-up (2011–2017):** Generally,
	participants who developed Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) during
	follow-up visits were excluded from the study, with the exception
	of those enrolled in the naproxen clinical trial (INTREPAD). Ten
	participants were excluded between 2012 and 2017 due to cognitive
	decline. (Note: This exclusion practice changed in Phase 2,
	starting around 2016, where participants who developed MCI or
	dementia were no longer excluded).
5.  **Medical/Pharmacological Exclusions:** Exclusion criteria also
	included known or identified cognitive disorders, current
	alcohol/barbiturate/benzodiazepine abuse, and use of certain
	medications such as acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine,
	certain doses of Vitamin E or aspirin, opiates, NSAIDs, or certain
	anti-coagulants. Clinically significant liver/kidney disease,
	anemia, and uncontrolled hypertension were also exclusionary.

Final determination of eligibility was made by clinical consensus
among study physicians, a research nurse, and a neuropsychologist.

### Retrospective Data Sharing Consent

Of the 387 participants included in the cohort, **348**
retrospectively agreed to have their data shared openly with the
neuroscience community following a restructuring of the StoP-AD Centre
operations in 2017. A total of 373 participants were reached during
this re-consent process, and 93% of those reached agreed to the
sharing.

### INTREPID

The cohort divided between individuals enrolled in the observational
cohort of the INTREPAD trial. The INTREPAD trial was interested in
screening for a genomic familial link. This criteria changed the
timing of some of the longitudinal observations.

The eligibility sessions collected T1w and and fMRI data, while the
follow up enrollment session collected DWI. The observational cohorts
had followups scheduled at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Additionally,
the INTREPAD cohort had much more rapid follow ups from their baseline
scan, at 3, 12, and 24 months as well as the 36 and 48 month
observations.

### Imaging Data

Stage one of the data consists of 349 subjects with up to 4 years of
follow-up scans. The imaging data collected for the participants
include:
- T1w Anatomical
- Resting State fMRI (rsfMRI)
- Task fMRI (tfMRI) - Memory Encoding and Retrieval
- Diffusion Weighted imaging (DWI)
- Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL)

#### dMRI Data Features

The Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data collection for
the PREVENT-AD cohort evolved across two major phases of data
acquisition (Phase 1: 2011–2017; Phase 2: Post-2019).

The changes in the dMRI protocol primarily reflect an upgrade in the
MRI scanner.

### Phase 1 dMRI Parameters (2011–2017, Stage 1)

During Phase 1 of data acquisition (Stage 1), the multi-modal MRI
sequences, including dMRI, were harmonized with the Alzheimer’s
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol.

The specific dMRI sequence parameters available for this phase are
detailed below:

| Parameter | Detail | Source Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scanner** | Siemens TIM Trio 3 Tesla MRI scanner | |
| **Coil** | Siemens standard 12-channel coil | |
| **Sequence Type** | EPI 2D transversal; single shell diffusion MRI | |
| **TR (Repetition Time)** | 9300 ms | |
| **TE (Echo Time)** | 92 ms | |
| **FOV (Field of View)** | $192 \times 192 \times 130$ mm | |
| **Phase Encode** | A-P (Anterior-Posterior) | |
| **BW (Bandwidth)** | 1628 Hz/px | |
| **Resolution** | $2 \times 2 \times 2$ mm$^3$ | |
| **b-values/Directions** | $b = \text{ s/mm}^2$ with 65 total directions (1 b0 direction and 64 diffusion directions) | |
| **Scan Time** | 10.15 min | |

### Phase 2 dMRI Parameters (Post-2019)

MRI acquisition resumed in January 2019 after the original Siemens Tim
Trio scanner was upgraded to a **Prisma Fit**. The MRI protocol was
subsequently updated.

The key changes for diffusion MRI acquisition in Phase 2 included:

1.  **Scanner Upgrade:** The scanner used was the upgraded **Prisma
	Fit** 3T.
2.  **Coil Usage:** The **32-channel head coil** was used exclusively.
3.  **Protocol Change:** The diffusion MRI shifted from a **single
	shell to a multi-shell** protocol.
4.  **Data Type:** The acquired data is described as multi-shell
	diffusion imaging.

While the sources confirm the use of multi-shell diffusion imaging in
Phase 2, the exact numerical acquisition parameters (TR, TE, b-values,
directions for the multi-shell sequence) are referenced to
supplementary Table 4 in the sources, the details of which are not
explicitly provided in the available text.

### Derivative Measures

For both phases, the dMRI data was processed to derive quantitative
measures of white matter properties. These analytic measures include
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics derived from the multi-shell
dMRI data, specifically:

*   Diffusion properties of white matter tracts quantified using
	**TractoFlow, RBXFlow, and Tractometry Flow**.
*   DTI measures in 52 white matter bundles reconstructed from
	whole-brain tractograms computed using the SCIL Tractoflow
	pipelines.
*   Common dMRI analytical measures listed in the available data
	repository include Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity
	(MD), Axial Diffusivity (AD), and Radial Diffusivity (RD).

### Clinical and Behavioral Data

The Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
(RBANS) was used to evaluate cognitive ability by estimating 5 Index
scores (immediate memory, delayed memory, language, attention and
visuospatial capacities) and a total score, consists of 12 subtests:
- list learning
- story learning
- figure copy
- line orientation
- picture naming
- semantic fluency
- digit span
- coding
- list recall
- list recognition
- story recall
- figure recall

The RBANS is a comprehensive, approximately 30-minute test designed to
assess cognitive performance over time. It yields not only a total
score (Global cognition), but also **five specific Index scores** that
categorize cognitive function:

#### RBANS Subtests and Corresponding Cognitive Domains

The 12 subtests listed contribute to one of the five specific
cognitive domains (Index scores) as follows:

| Subtest Name | Cognitive Domain (Index Score) | Description/Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **List Learning** | **Immediate Memory** | Assesses the ability to immediately learn and recall information. |
| **Story Learning** | **Immediate Memory** | Assesses immediate recall of narrative information. |
| **Figure Copy** | **Visuospatial/Constructional** | Assesses the ability to accurately reproduce a visual figure. |
| **Line Orientation** | **Visuospatial/Constructional** | Assesses visuospatial capacities. |
| **Picture Naming** | **Language** | Measures expressive language abilities. |
| **Semantic Fluency** | **Language** | Measures ability to generate words within a specific semantic category (a measure of verbal fluency). |
| **Digit Span** | **Attention** | Assesses short-term auditory memory and attention span. |
| **Coding** | **Attention** | Assesses processing speed and attention. |
| **List Recall** | **Delayed Memory** | Assesses delayed free recall of the word list learned earlier. |
| **List Recognition** | **Delayed Memory** | Assesses delayed recognition of the learned word list. |
| **Story Recall** | **Delayed Memory** | Assesses delayed free recall of the narrative learned earlier. |
| **Figure Recall** | **Delayed Memory** | Assesses delayed recall of the figure copied earlier. |

#### Context and Scoring in PREVENT-AD

*   **Longitudinal Assessment:** RBANS was performed annually at
	baseline (BL00) and at subsequent follow-up visits (FU12, FU24,
	FU36, FU48, etc.).
*   **Version Rotation:** To reduce practice effects during
	longitudinal assessment, the RBANS is available in **four
	equivalent versions** (A, B, C, D) in both French and English.
*   **Scoring Metrics:** The RBANS data are scored following the
	manual. Index scores are typically age-adjusted with a mean of 100
	and a standard deviation (SD) of 15, while subtest scores have a
	mean of 10 and a SD of 3.
*   **Age-Specific Norms:** In PREVENT-AD, scores were calculated
	using both the standard age-adjusted method AND using norms
	specified exclusively for individuals aged 60–69 years. Both
	scoring methods are available in the registered data repository,
	allowing for the detection of potential decline with advancing
	age.
*   **Clinical Screening:** Low performance on the RBANS (e.g., index
	score > 1 SD below the mean in two different cognitive domains)
	during follow-up visits could trigger a complete cognitive
	evaluation by a certified neuropsychologist to determine if the
	individual developed Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
*   **Data Availability:** A total of 2662 RBANS assessments were
collected between 2012 and 2023, with 2493 assessments from the 348
participants who agreed to data sharing available to
researchers. However, RBANS data collected during the COVID-19
pandemic (March 2020 and July 2021) were obtained virtually and are
**not shared** because not all tasks were completed, and index scores
could not be computed reliably.  Additionally, standard Clinical
measures like the MOCA and UPDRS are also collected.

Other scores and demographics are available as well.

## Longitudinal Features

The PREVENT-AD dataset's longitudinal neuroimaging acquisitions are
divided into two distinct periods, Phase 1 (referred to as Stage 1)
and Phase 2 (referred to as Stage 2), reflecting changes in funding,
protocol, and available technologies.

Here are the details regarding the characteristics of the longitudinal
neuroimaging acquisitions and the differences between Phase 1 and
Phase 2:

## Overview of Phases

| Feature | Phase 1 (Stage 1) (November 2011 to November 2017) | Phase 2 (Stage 2) (Starting late 2017/January 2019) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Duration/Period** | November 2011 to November 2017. | Started after November 2017, with MRI scanning resuming in January 2019. |
| **Funding/Structure** | Top-down, standard annual data collection structure. Supported by a \$13.5M public-private partnership. | Bottom-up structure where core data (e.g., RBANS) continued, but other assessments depended on **investigator-driven project grants**. |
| **Scanner/Coil** | Siemens TIM Trio 3 Tesla MRI scanner. Standard **12-channel coil** generally used. | Siemens TIM Trio 3 Tesla MRI scanner upgraded to a **Prisma Fit**. Exclusively used the **32-channel head coil**. |
| **Frequency** | Multi-modal MRI performed on an **annual basis**. | MRI scans were done, but **not necessarily performed on all participants and/or systematically every year**. |
| **LP/CSF** | Lumbar puncture (LP) was **optional** initially, then proposed to the full cohort in 2016, and became **mandatory in 2017** for new participants. | LP and blood draws continued but were **not necessarily performed systematically every year**. |
| **Exclusion Criteria** | Participants who developed Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) were generally **excluded** from the study. | Participants who developed MCI or dementia were **no longer excluded**; their cognitive performance is systematically reviewed. |
| **New Modalities** | Focused primarily on MRI, cognitive, biofluid (including optional CSF) and neurosensory data. | Introduced A$\beta$ and tau **Positron Emission Tomography (PET)**, and **Magnetoencephalography (MEG)**. |

### Phase 1 (Stage 1) Neuroimaging Acquisitions (2011–2017)

Phase 1 neuroimaging primarily focused on Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI). Most MRI sequences (3T) were harmonized with the Alzheimer’s
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol to facilitate
interoperability between cohorts.

**Acquired Modalities (Standard Protocol):** The acquisitions were
performed using a Siemens Tim Trio 3T scanner, typically with a
standard 12-channel coil. The sequences included:

*   **T1-weighted (T1w):** MPRAGE.
*   **T2*-weighted**.
*   **FLAIR** (Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) images.
*   **Diffusion MRI (DWI)**.
*   **Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL)**.
*   **Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)** (Resting State BOLD).
*   **Task fMRI:** An episodic memory fMRI task was performed for most
	participants.

**Protocol Change (Starting June 2016):** For participants enrolled
between June 2016 and November 2017 (n=48), the protocol changed
slightly, using a 32-channel coil:

*   The **task fMRI was removed/replaced**.
*   **MP2RAGE** was added for quantitative T1 maps.
*   A **multi-echo gradient echo** was added for T2* maps.
*   A **high in-plane resolution T2-weighted image** (T2-weighted
	SPACE) was added to assess brain microstructure and segment
	hippocampal subfields.

### Phase 2 (Stage 2) Neuroimaging Acquisitions (Post-2017)

The shift to Phase 2 operations in late 2017 necessitated changes,
although core cognitive data collection continued. MRI scanning
resumed in January 2019, utilizing the upgraded hardware and revised
protocols.

**MRI Protocol Updates:** When MRI scanning resumed in 2019, the 3T
Siemens Tim Trio scanner had been upgraded to a **Prisma Fit**, and
the 32-channel head coil was used exclusively. Key differences
included changes to existing sequences:

*   **fMRI changed from single- to multi-echo**.
*   **Diffusion MRI changed from single shell to multi-shell**.
*   Sequences acquired include 1mm$^3$ 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE,
	0.6mm$^3$ 3D T2-weighted SPACE, 3mm$^3$ resting-state multi-echo
	functional MRI, 1x1x3mm FLAIR, and multi-shell diffusion imaging.
*   **FLAIR data were only acquired in 2019-2020** after the upgrade.

**New Modalities Introduced:** Phase 2 expanded the neuroimaging scope
significantly by adding Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and
Magnetoencephalography (MEG).

1.  **Positron Emission Tomography (PET):**
	*   **Amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) PET** scans were collected (n=232
		shared) using **$[^{18}\text{F}]\text{NAV}4694$**.
	*   **Tau PET** scans were collected (n=229 shared) using
		**$[^{18}\text{F}]\text{Flortaucipir}$**.
	*   Scans were acquired on a high-resolution research tomograph
		(HRRT) at the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre.

2.  **Magnetoencephalography (MEG):**
	*   **Resting-state MEG scans** were collected (n=114 shared),
		usually on the same day as an A$\beta$ or tau PET scan.
	*   MEG data were collected using a whole-head CTF MEG system.


### Improvements Over Time

The second phase (Phase 2) of data acquisition in the PREVENT-AD
cohort, which began after November 2017, introduced several
substantial methodological improvements and new modalities aimed at
enhancing the quality, depth, and predictive value of the collected
data.

The expected improvements to the quality of the data in PREVENT-AD
Phase 2 stem from three main areas: enhanced neuroimaging acquisition
techniques, the introduction of novel high-sensitivity molecular
biomarkers, and extended longitudinal follow-up/clinical tracking.

### I. Enhanced Neuroimaging Acquisition Quality

The greatest expected quality improvements come from hardware upgrades
and modified imaging protocols, especially for MRI and functional
imaging:

*   **MRI Scanner Upgrade and Coil Usage:** The Siemens Tim Trio MRI
	scanner used in Phase 1 was upgraded to a **Prisma Fit** scanner
	when scanning resumed in 2019. Furthermore, the higher-channel
	**32-channel head coil** was used exclusively, replacing the mixed
	use of 12-channel and 32-channel coils in Phase 1. This hardware
	upgrade generally yields superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
	image quality.
*   **Diffusion MRI (dMRI) Improvement:** The dMRI protocol was
	updated from a single-shell sequence (used in Phase 1) to a
	**multi-shell diffusion MRI** sequence. Multi-shell data allows
	for fitting increasingly complex models that better summarize the
	orientation of water movement in tissue, leading to more advanced
	microstructure estimates beyond standard Diffusion Tensor Imaging
	(DTI), such as **Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density
	Imaging (NODDI)** measures (Neurite Density Index [NDI],
	Orientation Dispersion Index [ODI], and Isotropic Volume Fraction
	[ISOVF]). The new multi-shell data has already led to key insights
	into brain microstructural alterations.
*   **Functional MRI (fMRI) Improvement:** The resting-state fMRI
	acquisition was changed from a **single-echo** to a **multi-echo**
	sequence. Multi-echo fMRI is known to help improve image quality
	by facilitating the removal of non-BOLD noise components, leading
	to cleaner functional connectivity estimates.
*   **Introduction of PET Imaging (Amyloid and Tau):** Phase 2
	introduced standardized in-vivo measures of core Alzheimer's
	pathologies through Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning.
	*   **High Resolution:** The PET scans (A$\beta$ and tau) were
		acquired on a **brain-dedicated Siemens/CTI high-resolution
		research tomograph (HRRT)**. This scanner provides a high
		spatial resolution of $2.4 \text{mm}$ at the center of the
		field of view, which is superior to most other scanners.
	*   **Standardized Quantification:** The analytic measures
		provided include **Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVRs)**
		across Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas regions and, specifically
		for A$\beta$ PET, the standardized **Global A$\beta$ PET
		Centiloid values**.
*   **Inclusion of Neuroimaging Analytic Measures:** Instead of only
	sharing raw data, the Phase 2 release innovated by including
	**analytic neuroimaging measures (data derivatives)**, such as
	connectome matrices and volumes, computed by imaging experts. This
	eases data usage for researchers who may not specialize in
	neuroimaging processing. A concrete example of this is the sharing
	of five dominant patterns of brain atrophy quantified by an
	independent group and shared back to the repository.

### II. Introduction of Novel High-Sensitivity Biomarkers

Phase 2 significantly expanded the range and sensitivity of fluid
biomarkers collected, enhancing the ability to track the preclinical
stage of the disease:

*   **Advanced Plasma Biomarkers:** The new release incorporates
	**novel longitudinal AD plasma biomarkers**. This includes highly
	specific and sensitive markers quantified using in-house Single
	molecule array (Simoa) assays in collaboration with the University
	of Gothenburg:
	*   **Amyloid-beta** (A$\beta$1-40, A$\beta$1-42).
	*   **Neurodegeneration and inflammation markers** (GFAP, NfL).
	*   Highly predictive **Phosphorylated tau species**
		($\text{p-tau}181$, $\text{p-tau}231$, and
		$\text{p-tau}217$). Plasma $\text{p-tau}217$ has been shown to
		be highly predictive, with most PREVENT-AD participants having
		abnormal values progressing from cognitively unimpaired (CU)
		to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) within 10 years.
*   **CSF Biomarker Expansion:** New CSF data includes A$\beta$1-40
	and A$\beta$1-42 measured using automated immunoassay and
	$\text{p-tau}217$ measured using an in-house Simoa assay.
*   **Comprehensive Proteomics:** High-throughput aptamer-based
	proteomics assay data (SomaScan 7K panel) measuring approximately
	6,600 unique protein targets in baseline CSF samples is now
	shared.

### III. Extended Longitudinal Follow-up and Clinical Depth

Phase 2 data enhances quality by addressing the crucial need for
longer follow-up in preclinical AD studies, which affects the
interpretation of results:

*   **Extended Follow-up:** Phase 2 includes **six years of additional
	cognitive and MRI follow-ups**, extending the data set beyond the
	Phase 1 period (2011–2017). The median follow-up is now over 8
	years, with observations available for more than 12 years in
	total. The length of follow-up has been shown to "dramatically
	change the interpretation of the results," for instance,
	increasing the percentage of A$\beta$ positive/tau negative
	($\text{A+T-}$ ) individuals who progressed to MCI from 9% to 42%
	after $2.4$ years of additional follow-up.
*   **Improved Clinical Progression Tracking:** The systematic
	exclusion of participants who developed MCI was discontinued in
	Phase 2, meaning data is now available for participants who
	developed MCI or dementia (105 participants were classified as
	having MCI as of December 2023). This is critical for
	characterizing the trajectory from preclinical status to cognitive
	impairment.
*   **New Modalities (MEG and Actigraphy):** The inclusion of
	**Magnetoencephalography (MEG)** is a novelty, as this
	neuroimaging modality is rarely acquired in large longitudinal AD
	studies. MEG data provides unique insights into neurophysiological
	alterations (e.g., spectral power density estimates across six
	frequency bands). Additionally, **objective sleep measures**
	collected via wrist Actiwatches were introduced, providing
	high-quality objective behavioral data on sleep characteristics.

### Neuroimaging Analytic Measures

Phase 2 also emphasized the sharing of **analytic neuroimaging
measures** (data derivatives) computed by imaging experts, provided in
CSV files to ease data usage.

These analytical measures derived from **all MRI modalities** in Phase
2 include:

*   **Morphometric measurements** (cortical thickness, volume, surface
	area) using FreeSurfer.
*   **Machine learning derived measures** (brain parcellations,
	indices of aging and AD) using NiChart.
*   **Brain-wide functional connectivity matrices** from resting-state
	fMRI.
*   **Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures** (diffusion properties
	of white matter tracts) using TractoFlow and related pipelines.
*   **White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes** derived from T1w,
	T2w, and FLAIR images.
*   **Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)** quantification from ASL
	sequences.
*   **Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR)** images and values for
	A$\beta$ and tau PET scans.
*   **Relative spectral power density estimates** across cortical
	regions from MEG data.

The overall transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 represents a move from
standardized annual multi-modal MRI and core clinical measures to a
more flexible, investigator-driven data collection strategy that
dramatically expanded the breadth of high-end biomarkers (PET, MEG,
multi-shell dMRI) collected.

## Possible Data Products

The PREVENT-AD cohort collects rich multimodal data, including
extensive neuroimaging, genetics, and pathology biomarkers, enabling
the construction of various multimodal connectomes beyond the standard
functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI).

The data available supports the construction of connectomes across
three primary domains: **Structural Connectivity**,
**Neurophysiological Connectivity**, and **Pathology-based Networks**.

### 1. Structural Connectomes (using Diffusion MRI)

The raw Diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, including multi-shell sequences
collected in Phase 2, is crucial for modeling white matter pathways
and building structural connectomes (often referred to as the
structural "wiring diagram" of the brain).

Structural connectomes can be built by running tractography algorithms
(such as those used in TractoFlow, which has already processed
PREVENT-AD dMRI data) between parcellated gray matter
regions. Possible resulting structural connectomes include:

*   **Streamline Count/Density Connectomes:** These networks quantify
	the strength of the anatomical connection (edge) between two brain
	regions (nodes) based on the **log$_{10}$ Streamline Count** or
	**Log$_{10}$ Streamline Density** derived from tractography.
*   **Streamline Length Connectomes:** These networks quantify
	connections based on the **Log$_{10}$ Streamline Length** between
	regions.
*   **Validated Structural Connectomes using LiFE:** Connectome edges
	can be weighted using the **Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE)**
	method. This method estimates a connectome by testing the
	"Strength of Evidence" for each edge based on how well the
	tractography streamlines fit the underlying diffusion data (using
	a virtual lesion method).

### 2. Multimodal Structural Connectomes (Combining dMRI Measures)

The edges of the structural connectome derived from dMRI can be mapped
with microstructural properties to create multimodal networks that
reflect tissue integrity, rather than just anatomical presence.

*   **DTI-derived Microstructural Connectomes:** By averaging
	quantitative metrics derived from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
	along reconstructed white matter pathways (tracts), connectomes
	can be built based on:
	*   **Fractional Anisotropy (FA):** Connectome weights could
		reflect the mean or standard deviation of FA along the tract
		profile connecting two regions.
	*   **Axial Diffusivity (AD), Radial Diffusivity (RD), and Mean
		Diffusivity (MD):** Although not explicitly listed as
		connectome outputs, DTI measures are already extracted for
		white matter tracts in PREVENT-AD.
*   **Advanced Microstructural Connectomes (e.g., NODDI):** Given the
	multi-shell diffusion data available from Phase 2, more complex
	models like Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging
	(NODDI) can be applied. Connectomes could then be built based on
	measures such as:
	*   **Neurite Density Index (NDI)**.
	*   **Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI)**.
	*   **Isotropic Volume Fraction (ISOVF)**.

### 3. Neurophysiological Connectomes (using MEG)

The PREVENT-AD dataset includes resting-state Magnetoencephalography
(MEG) data, a modality that measures brain electrical activity
directly.

*   **Frequency-Band Specific Connectomes:** Unlike fMRI, which
	measures slow hemodynamic changes, MEG data can be used to
	construct connectomes reflecting instantaneous connectivity (e.g.,
	phase synchrony or power coupling) across specific neural
	oscillation bands:
	*   Delta (2–4 Hz).
	*   Theta (5–7 Hz).
	*   Alpha (8–12 Hz).
	*   Beta (13–30 Hz).
	*   Gamma1 (30–60 Hz).
	*   Gamma2 (60–90 Hz).

### 4. Morphometric and Molecular Networks (Multimodal Integration)

Multimodal networks can be derived by correlating non-connectivity
measures across anatomical regions defined by atlases like the
Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas.

*   **Morphometric Similarity Networks:** Based on the volumetric
	measures already calculated (e.g., cortical thickness, cortical
	volume, and subcortical volume derived from T1w using FreeSurfer),
	researchers could build networks where the connectivity between
	two nodes is defined by the statistical similarity (covariance or
	correlation) of their morphological properties across
	participants.
*   **Pathology-Pathology Covariance Networks:** The availability of
	regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for both
	Amyloid-$A\beta$ PET and tau PET across DK atlas regions, allows
	for the construction of networks describing how $A\beta$
	deposition in one region correlates with $A\beta$ or tau
	deposition in another region across subjects. This maps patterns
	of pathology accumulation and spread, which is highly relevant to
	Alzheimer’s disease progression.
