# [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/)

A free and open platform for validating and sharing BIDS-compliant MRI, PET, MEG, EEG, and iEEG data

## Description

OpenNeuro is a data archive that follows the FAIR principles for data management, and which we hope can be a useful resource for your research projects. In this guide, we describe browsing, downloading, uploading and managing OpenNeuro datasets.



### Get Data

Browse and explore public datasets and analyses from a wide range of global contributors. Our collection of public datasets continues to grow as more and more become BIDS compatible.

Download and use public data to create new datasets and run your own analyses.

### Share Data

Privately share your data so your colleagues can view and edit your work.

Publish your dataset where anyone can view, download, and run analyses on it.

### Use Data

Create snapshots of your datasets to ensure past analyses remain reproducible as your datasets grow and change. Publish any of your snapshots while you continue work on your original data behind the scenes.

Explore your published OpenNeuro dataset using brainlife.io's computing network. Utilize their community driven apps to run a variety of analysis and processing applications in the browser.

## Dataset

There are 770 datasets with other 33,000 subject observations.

## Register

OpenNeuro does not require you to have an account to browse and download public datasets, but having an account does allow you to save those that interest you or to subscribe to them for email updates. Naturally, you will also need an account if you plan to store or manage your own datasets.
