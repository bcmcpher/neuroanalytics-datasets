# Prevent-AD

## Description

The
[PREVENT-AD](https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/prevent-alzheimer-program/)
research group is now releasing data openly with the intention to
contribute to the community’s growing understanding of AD
pathogenesis.

The PREVENT-Alzheimer program wants to recruit 500 participants. Their
contributions will be the key to finding strategies that can slow or
reverse brain changes that may occur in older people who do not suffer
from dementia. Recruitment is currently closed.

PREVENT-Alzheimer means PRe-symptomatic EValuation of Experimental or
Novel Treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. The PREVENT-AD program is
the principal clinical research activity of the Centre for Studies on
Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease, or StoP-AD Centre. The goal of this
program is to study memory and brain changes in healthy people over
the age of 55. While some people in this age group begin to develop
apparent memory problems, many more may have undetected brain changes
that mark the very beginning of the disease long before the onset of
symptoms.

With rapid advances in technology, such as high-resolution brain
scanning methods or the precise examination of brain chemicals, we can
now detect early evidence of brain changes. What’s more, we can likely
track these changes over time. These brain changes are more likely to
occur in individuals who have had either a parent or sibling affected
by AD. This is why we require that our participants have a close
family member affected by the disease.

## The Dataset

### INTREPID

The cohort divided between individuals enrolled in the observational
cohort of the INTREPAD trial. The INTREPAD trial was interested in
screening for a genomic familial link. This criteria changed the
timing of some of the longitudinal observations.

The eligibility sessions collected T1w and and fMRI data, while the
follow up enrollment session collected DWI. The observational cohorts
had followups scheduled at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Additionally,
the INTREPAD cohort had much more rapid follow ups from their baseline
scan, at 3, 12, and 24 months as well as the 36 and 48 month
observations.

### Inclusion Criteria

Taken from Table 1.

- Inclusion criteria
- - Self-reported parental or multiple-sibling (2 or more*) history of
  Alzheimer-like dementia
- - Age 60 years or older (persons aged 55–59 years and < 15 years
  younger than their affected index relative were also eligible)
- - Minimum of 6 years of formal education
- - Study partner available to provide information on cognitive status
- - Sufficient fluency in spoken and written French and/or English
- - Ability and intention to participate in regular visits
- - Agreement for periodic donation of blood and urine samples
- - Agreement to participate in periodic multimodal assessments via
  MRI and LP for CSF collection (LP optional at first, then mandatory
  (in 2017) for participation)
- - Agreement to limit use of medicines as required by clinical trial
  protocols, if applicable
- - Provision of informed consent of the different protocols

- Exclusion criteria
- - Cognitive disorders - Known or identified during eligibility
  assessments (MoCA and CDR or exhaustive neuropsychological
  evaluation when needed)
- - Use of acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors including tacrine,
  donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine
- - Use of memantine or other approved prescription cognitive enhancer
- - Use of vitamin E at>600 i.u. / day or aspirin at > 325 mg / day
- - Use of opiates (oxycodone, hydrocodone, tramadol, meperidine,
  hydromorphone)
- - Use of NSAIDs or regular use of systemic or inhalation
  corticosteroids
- - Clinically significant hypertension (accepted if controlled
  medically), anemia, significant liver or kidney disease
- - Concurrent use of warfarin, ticlopidine, clopidrogel, or similar
  anti-coagulant
- - Current plasma Creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl (132 mmol/l)
- - Current alcohol, barbiturate or benzodiazepine abuse/dependence

### Imaging Data

Stage one of the data consists of 349 subjects with up to 4 years of
follow-up scans. The imaging data collected for the participants
include:
- T1w Anatomical
- Resting State fMRI (rsfMRI)
- Task fMRI (tfMRI) - Memory Encoding and Retrieval
- Diffusion Weighted imaging (DWI)
- Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL)

### Clinical and Behavioral Data

The Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
(RBANS) was used to evaluate cognitive ability by estimating 5 Index
scores (immediate memory, delayed memory, language, attention and
visuospatial capacities) and a total score, consists of 12 subtests:
- list learning
- story learning
- figure copy
- line orientation
- picture naming
- semantic fluency
- digit span
- coding
- list recall
- list recognition
- story recall
- figure recall

Additionally, standard Clinical measures like the MOCA and UPDRS are
also collected.

Other scores and demographics are available as well.

## CNS Projects

The goal is to create common processing derivatives for multiple
projects to utilize.
