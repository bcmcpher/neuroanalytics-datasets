brainlife.io is an open-source, free and secure reproducible neuroscience analysis platform.

## Description

The platform allows to analyze Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Data can either be uploaded from local computers or imported from public archives such as OpenNeuro.org. Over 400+ data processing Apps are available on brainlife.io to build custom data workflows. Thousands of jobs can be submitted using shared clusters or on users' compute resource. Users can perform group-level statistical analysis or apply machine learning methods using Jupyter notebooks. A single record containing the entire data workflow (from raw data to published figures) can be published addressed by with a unique digital object identifier (DOI).

### Developed for Neuroscientists

Brainlife is a community-oriented project led by the Pestilli Lab at UT-Austin, and contributed to by over ten additional research groups and institutions. The platform is designed and constantly improved by a community of developers and researchers for the benefit of other neuroscientists. Over 400 data processing Apps have been developed by researchers from around the world.

### A turnkey analysis platform

Brainlife is a turnkey software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution. It is not software that users must download, install, and operate at their institution. By simply signing up, you will have immediate access to our large storage systems, and many major HPC resources.

### Large storage and computing resources

Brainlife provides millions of free computing hours supported by NSF and donated cycles to researchers and students. Brainlife also provides secure cloud storage for raw data as well as data derivatives.

### Reproducible Analysis

Automated capture of data processing steps. Capture data provenance and App versions when generating data derivatives. Ensure computational reproducibility via singularity and docker technology.

### Visualization

A variety of visualization tools can be launched directly from your web browser.
