Brain-CODE provides advanced data management services for neuroscience data.

## Description

Capture and manage data in real-time on Brain-CODE by using specialized tools accessible through your web browser. Currently, these tools include popular platforms such as: REDCap, OpenClinica, XNAT, LabKey and the Subject Registry, a custom participant management tool. These easy to use tools have the ability to capture a large variety of data types while ensuring the adoption of quality control standards and data curation processes.

### Data is centralized and standardized.

With robust processes to help inform and support researchers using the data capture tools and quality assurance/quality control metrics, the Brain-CODE team can help facilitate the proper curation and management of data. Customizable visual dashboards enable researchers to easily monitor study progress, manage their datasets and control how the datasets will be shared.

### Fostering Collaboration

Tools such as forums, analytics workspaces and administrative file sharing repositories are embedded in the Brain-CODE portal to enable greater scientific collaboration and data sharing between users.

### Maximizing Data Discovery

OBI has established standards for the variety of data types that are collected on Brain-CODE. These standards were based upon existing international standards such as CDISC and NINDS so that data can be combined not only within Brain-CODE, but also with other datasets. To date, these standards have been adopted by more than 35 institutions who conduct neuroscience research in Ontario. By standardizing data collection in this way, we hope to offer researchers using Brain-CODE the ability to compare their data with other researchers’ data in a synergistic “apples-to-apples” manner.

### Providing Enriched Datasets

The value of data on Brain-CODE may be further enhanced through the ability to link these datasets with other existing databases and informatics platforms in Canada and internationally. Developing these large scale data federation opportunities will allow for more extensive data analysis opportunities and innovative neuroscience discoveries.

### Visual Analytics

Brain-CODE provides researchers with advanced visual analytics capacity, powered by TIBCO Spotfire®. Visual analytics is a powerful way to quickly search and graphically represent interesting relationships and find statistically meaningful information in complex datasets.

### Analytics Workspace

Researchers and collaborators can access customized analytics workspaces and make use of analytics tools or bring their own tools into the workspace. Analytics can be brought to the data to minimize data transfer load and reduce data risks. Brain-CODE’s analytics workspace makes collaborations on data easy and available online on demand. In addition, these tools can access high performance computing resources for greater storage and processing speeds.

### Quality Control and Quality Assurance Pipelines

To increase scientific value of data for both initial analyses and
sharing, many datasets require processing in one or multiple ways. For
this purpose, Brain-CODE is actively developing analysis pipelines for
validating the quality of the data for downstream analyses.

### Big Data, Big Responsibility

Privacy and security features have been incorporated into the very foundation of Brain-CODE, which are reinforced by state-of-the-art approaches to keep data safe. With leading security, privacy policies and governance infrastructure built into Brain-CODE, OBI has been designated a "Privacy by Design" Ambassador by the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario. This rigorous approach maintains the accessibility of research data for big discoveries without compromising security.

### Participant Privacy

In the era of data sharing, it is imperative that participant data remain anonymous. Any data that go into Brain-CODE will have identifying information removed using state-of-the-art encryption and de-identification tools designed to assess the risk posed to a participant’s privacy. By embedding the 7 foundational principles of Privacy by Design into Brain-CODE and adhering to PHIPA, we can ensure that researchers have the information they need, and that participants are protected.

### Secure Platform

Brain-CODE adheres not only to high levels of data privacy, but also data security at the platform level. Federation and linking with other databases involves the implementation of a high-security data transfer infrastructure. This includes enhanced validation certificates at the CAC (Centre for Advanced Computing) facility which meets 21 CFR part 11 standards. Working with a team of experts, the Ontario Brain Institute has developed clear and comprehensive guidelines on data privacy and governance. These governance documents outline how the data are collected, stored, and accessed by Brain-CODE users.
