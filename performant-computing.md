## Dask - Parallel Computing

Dask is a Python library for parallel and distributed computing. Dask
is easy to use and set up, providing powerful computing options at
scale while unlocking complex algorithms.

Dask makes accessess parallel processing for variety of common data
applications easy, such as:
- Multithreaded processing of large arrays and tabular data frames
- Embarassingly parallel execution of separate jobs
- Parameter sweeps of machine learning processing

`Dask` can be run as either as part of scripts or as a backend for a
`Jupyter-Notebook`. In this context, the notebook is able to take
advantage of the parallel processing accelartion `Dask` can provide
from a common and simple to deploy tool.
