# Hotchkiss Brain Institute (HBI)

https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/

The Hotchkiss Brain Institute (HBI) is located at the University of
Calgary. They are a research hub for a variety of labs working across
many different domains and scales of neuroscience.

## Research Priorities

### Healthy Brain Aging

Healthy Brain Aging research is focused on understanding the
fundamental causes, and developing new and improved treatments, for
neurological and mental health conditions affecting the aging brain.

The life expectancy of Canadians has risen significantly in the past
century. The average Canadian now faces an increased risk of
experiencing health issues associated with degenerating nervous and
vascular systems. In an aging population, dementia has already become
the most expensive medical condition in the Canadian health care
system. Other brain conditions such as stroke and Parkinson’s disease,
to name only two, are also a concern for our communities.

Researchers in the Healthy Brain Aging theme are working to better
understand the interplay between aging and the increased risk of
dysfunction in the nervous and vascular systems. They aim to identify
new ways to detect and prevent diseases and conditions associated with
the aging brain, as well as to improve treatments and outcomes for
individuals already dealing with age-related brain health challenges.

### Brain and Behavior

Understanding how the brain controls behaviour remains one the biggest
fundamental challenges of neuroscience. How behaviours are controlled
or modified, how thoughts are turned into actions and how memories are
gained or lost will be understood by studying the synaptic circuitry
of the brain. Neurological and mental health conditions that range
from epilepsy to the mental health disorders of depression and anxiety
also have their basis in structural and/or functional alterations in
the circuitry of the brain. A key trigger for many brain disorders is
stress. The functional circuitry of stress remains to be fully
understood. Frequently affecting adolescents and young adults,
understanding the basis of neurological and mental health conditions
is the focus of Brain & Behaviour. One out of every three Canadians
will be affected by a brain or mental health disorder in their life
and early detection and treatment is often critical to a swift
recovery.

Researchers in the Brain & Behaviour theme are applying collaborative
approaches and cutting-edge technology to advance our understanding of
the cellular communication in the brain and how it influences
behaviour. This research is guiding new treatments for existing
conditions as well as developing important early-stage interventions
to prevent the progression of disease, particularly in young people.

### Neural Injury and Repair

Neurons and glia are the building blocks of the nervous
system. Injuries to neuronal and glial cells are devastating and often
lead to lifelong disability. Nervous system injuries can be a
consequence of accident or illness and therefore they are difficult to
predict or prevent.

Injuries can be initiated by immune mechanisms inside the body, as is
the case for multiple sclerosis, changes in blood flow to the brain,
as occurs after a stroke, or through trauma or accidents, as is the
case for concussion and spinal cord injuries. A fundamental
understanding of the mechanisms of neural injury, developing
approaches to speed recovery and rehabilitate those who have neural
injuries is the focus of Neural Injury & Repair.

Researchers in the Neural Injury & Repair theme are searching for new
ways to treat damaged neurons. Using advanced technologies such as
sophisticated imaging, robotics and biomedical techniques, our
research teams are translating their findings into effective therapies
to improve the lives of nerve-injured patients.

## Open Science Priority

The University of Calgary’s Hotchkiss Brain Institute (HBI) is the
first to partner with McGill University's Tanenbaum Open Science
Institute (TOSI) and The Neuro in a commitment to adopting Open
Science approaches across its research and innovation efforts. This
major endeavour is supported by a $2M commitment from the Tanenbaum
Open Science Institute and the Larry & Judy Tanenbaum Family
Foundation.

The HBI defines the 5 Principals of open science as:

### The Public Release of Research Data
The HBI and its members will release positive and negative research
findings, including observations, models used, data sources, reagents,
algorithms, software, and other scientific resources. This research
data shall be made publicly available no later than the publication
date of the first article that relies on these data or resources. The
HBI recognizes and prioritizes the responsibility of its members to
safeguard the dignity and privacy of research participants and respect
the rights and duties owed to them through the informed consent
process.

### External Research Partnerships
All research data and scientific resources generated through
investigator-initiated research partnerships that are supported by the
HBI – whether with commercial, philanthropic, or public sector
stakeholders – are to be released on the same basis as set out in
Principle 1, unless a contractual agreement requires that the release
of data from a given project be delayed. In such cases, the project
data shall be made public as soon as all contractual obligations (such
as review by the partner) are satisfied. Partners shall be informed
and agree to the HBI’s Open Science Principles at the outset of joint
investigator-initiated research ventures

### Involvement with Teams and Platforms
The HBI leads knowledge creation and innovation through the support of
its Brain and Mental Health Teams and NeuroTechnology Platforms. Open
Science, as set out in these Principles, will be supported by these
HBI Teams and Platforms in so far as their activities are supported by
the HBI.

### The Appropriate Management of Intellectual Property
The HBI and its members respect and support the need to translate
research discoveries to improving human health. However, the institute
will ensure intellectual property and patent concerns do not hinder
the HBI Open Science Principles.

### Valuing Research and Participant Autonomy
The HBI supports the autonomy of its stakeholders - including but not
limited to: researchers, staff, trainees and participants - through
recognizing their right to decline to participate in research and
associated activities under an Open Science framework.

## Data Sharing

### Hotchkiss Real-World Evidence Platform
The Hotchkiss Real-World Evidence (RWE) platform is a new virtual data
platform established to assist HBI scientists with accessing,
integrating, and analysing routinely collected health data, data from
clinical registries, and external sources of data including surveys
and population-based datasets. We are a network of health care
providers and other stakeholders from the University of Calgary that
work together to optimize the care patients receive, with the aim to
improve health-related outcomes.

The main goal of the RWE platform is to catalyse health system and
population-based research across brain and mental health fields at the
Hotchkiss Brain Institute and the University of Calgary.

The key functions of the RWE initiative are to facilitate the
following:
1. Collaborations between investigators and stakeholders at HBI, UofC,
   Alberta and nationally
2. Access to routinely collected healthcare data
3. Linkage of investigator-collected data, or external data sources
4. Dataset creation and analysis

### RWE Datasets

#### Alzheimer's Disease in Alberta
The population of Alberta is aging and there are increasing numbers of
Albertans who are affected by Alzheimer’s disease and other types of
dementia. At the present time little is known about the numbers of
people affected by dementia in Alberta or how they interact with the
health care system. Understanding the health care journeys of people
with dementia is a critical step in understanding how to plan supports
and services for people affected by Alzheimer’s disease and their
families. Although there are medications currently approved for the
treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in Canada, these medications only
produce temporary benefits on dementia symptoms and do not change the
underlying disease course. However, research on treatments that may
impact on the underlying disease course of Alzheimer’s disease
(disease modifying therapies) are nearing the phase where these
treatments may be approved for use in Canada in the near future. These
new treatments will require that physicians and health services are
prepared to offer these medications and safely monitor their use
Canada. Understanding how physicians and other health care providers
currently assess and manage dementia is important to prepare our
health system to be ready for when these new treatments once they are
approved for use in Canada. Overall, our project will describe the
current state of people impacted by Alzheimer’s disease in Alberta and
identify strategies that may be used to help implement new dementia
treatments that may be approved by Health Canada in the future.

#### Measuring and Improving the Quality of Community-Based Dementia Care
There are an increasing number of people living with
dementia. Improving and maintaining quality of life is rated as the
highest priority for people living with dementia and their
caregivers. While many factors contribute to quality of life, high
quality health care is an important component of optimizing quality
of life for people living with dementia. The provision of
high-quality dementia care is also important to health care
providers, community service providers and society broadly. The first
step towards improving quality of care for people living with
dementia and their care partners is to measure the quality of
care. Our project will incorporate the perspectives of people living
with dementia, their family carers, and individuals representing
health and social services involved in dementia care to identify key
measures of health care quality for people living with dementia in
community settings. We will then assess the current state of dementia
care in Alberta, Canada and identify factors that are associated with
higher or lower scores on measures of health care quality. This
information will be shared with decision makers to inform future
strategies to monitor and improve dementia care both in Alberta and
throughout Canada. Overall, our project will provide critical
information about dementia care in Canada and internationally and
help identify ways to improve care for the growing population of
people impacted by dementia.

#### PRECISE-MH: PREcision Care with Information, Science and Experience
Addictions and mental health (AMH) problems are among the most
disabling, expensive and challenging health conditions in
Canada. Population-based administrative healthcare databases provide
an opportunity to study many of the factors associated with the
development of AMH and outcomes associated with these
disorders. Homelessness and involvement with police services are two
important factors associated with AMH Understanding the prevalence of
homelessness and police contact among individuals with AMH problems
and the characteristics of these individuals is critical to ensuring
there are adequate AMH services available to support individuals with
AMH problems who experience homelessness or who are in contact with
police services. Predicting which individuals with AMH problems are
most likely to experience homelessness or involvement with police
services is necessary in order to prevent potentially avoidable use
of homeless shelter and police services among individuals with AMH
problems. Our project first determine the characteristics of
individuals with AMH who experience homelessness or involvement with
police services. We will develop models to predict homelessness and
contact with police among individuals with AMH problems. Overall,
this project will help to better understand the factors associated
with the homelessness and police involvement among people with AMH
problems and inform the delivery of health, housing and police
services to better meet the needs of this complex population.
