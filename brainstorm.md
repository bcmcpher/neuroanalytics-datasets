# Brainstorm

Brainstorm is a collaborative, open-source application dedicated to the analysis of brain recordings: MEG, EEG, fNIRS, ECoG, depth electrodes and multiunit electrophysiology.Brainstorm is distributed as a comprehensive set of user-friendly tools for researchers using MEG/EEG as an experimental technique. Brainstorm features the possibility to model MEG and EEG neural generators either from the individual subject anatomy, or by using a template anatomy (MNI / Colin27) that can be warped to the individual scalp surface. Multiple interactive tools are available to view, register and process the MR images and the corresponding tessellated envelopes. It is maintained as a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) software environment for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological (e-phys) data.
