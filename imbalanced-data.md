# How to Analyze Samples with Imbalanced Groups

The query addresses a fundamental problem in machine learning and data
analysis known as **class imbalance**, where one group (the majority
class or abundant class) is much larger than the other group (the
minority class or rare class). When dealing with imbalanced data, most
machine learning algorithms do not perform effectively in detecting
the abnormal or rare class.

## Methods to Consider

Here are common ways of mitigating comparisons between these unequal
groups, categorized into evaluation strategies, data resampling
methods, and model design approaches:

### 1. Using the Right Evaluation Metrics

A crucial step is to avoid using accuracy as the primary metric, as a
model classifying all samples into the abundant class will appear to
have excellent accuracy (e.g., 99.8\% in an example) but provide no
valuable information. Instead, focus on metrics that specifically
measure performance on the minority class and reflect the costs of
misclassification:

*   **Precision/Specificity:** Measures how many selected instances
	are relevant.
*   **Recall/Sensitivity:** Measures how many relevant instances are
	selected (percentage of actual positives that were correctly
	classified).
*   **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
*   **MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient):** The correlation
	coefficient between the observed and predicted binary
	classifications.
*   **AUC (Area Under the Curve):** Refers to the area under the
	Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), which is equal
	to the probability that a classifier will rank a random positive
	sample higher than a random negative sample.
*   **AUPRC (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve):** Computes
	precision-recall pairs for different probability thresholds.

### 2. Resampling the Training Set

Resampling modifies the dataset structure to achieve better balance,
which helps training batches contain a sufficient number of minority
class examples.

#### Under-sampling (Downsampling the Majority Class)
Under-sampling balances the dataset by **reducing the size of the
abundant class**. This technique is typically used when the quantity
of data is already sufficient.

*   **Random Selection:** Keeps all samples in the rare class and
	randomly selects an equal number of samples from the abundant
	class to create a balanced dataset.
*   **Downsampling and Upweighting (A Two-Step Technique):** This
	approach separates the learning goals (what each class looks like
	and how common each class is):
	1.  **Downsample:** Artificially force the dataset to become more
		balanced by omitting many majority class examples during
		training (e.g., downsampling the majority class by a factor of
		25).
	2.  **Upweight:** Correct the resulting **prediction bias** by
		**upweighting** the majority class by the factor to which it
		was downsampled (e.g., treating the loss on a mistakenly
		predicted majority class example as if it were 25 errors).
	*   *Benefit:* This technique allows the model to learn the true
		distribution of classes and often leads to **faster
		convergence**.
*   **Clustering the Abundant Class:** Instead of relying on random
	samples, cluster the abundant class into $r$ groups, where $r$ is
	the number of cases in the rare class. Only the **medoid** (center
	of the cluster) of each group is kept, and the model is trained
	using the rare class samples and only the medoids of the abundant
	class.

#### Over-sampling (Oversampling the Minority Class)
Over-sampling is used when the quantity of data is insufficient. It
aims to balance the dataset by **increasing the size of rare
samples**.

*   **Repetition/Bootstrapping:** New rare samples are generated using
	repetition or bootstrapping.
*   **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique):** A common
	method for generating synthetic minority samples.
*   **TensorFlow/NumPy:** In platforms like TensorFlow, the minority
	class (positive examples) can be replicated to match the size of
	the negative examples, creating a balanced dataset. When trained
	batch-wise, this oversampled data can provide a smoother gradient
	signal compared to simply using class weights.

#### Combination and Proper Cross-Validation
*   A **combination of over- and under-sampling** is often successful.
*   **Cross-Validation Caution:** If using over-sampling,
	**cross-validation should always be done *before* over-sampling**
	the data. This prevents overfitting the model to the artificial
	bootstrapping results created by over-sampling.

### 3. Ensemble Methods

Ensemble techniques combine multiple models trained on subsets of the
imbalanced data to improve generalization:

*   **Ensembling Different Resampled Datasets:** Build $n$ models
	where each model uses all samples of the rare class and $n$
	differing samples randomly sampled from the abundant class (e.g.,
	keeping 1,000 rare cases and splitting 10,000 abundant cases into
	10 chunks for 10 models). This approach is horizontally scalable.
*   **Resampling with Different Ratios:** Fine-tune the ensemble
	approach by training different models with varying ratios between
	the rare and abundant class (e.g., a 1:1 ratio model and a 1:3
	ratio model).

### 4. Adjusting the Model Directly

Instead of modifying the data, methods can be applied directly to the
model structure or its objective function:

*   **Using Class Weights/Upweighting:** Pass weights for each class
	to the classifier, causing the model to "pay more attention" to
	examples from the under-represented class. The minority class is
	given a significantly higher weight (e.g., in a fraud detection
	example, the weight for the fraudulent class was 289.44 compared
	to 0.50 for the legitimate class).
	*   **Equivalency:** Using class weights is generally equivalent
		to changing the output bias or changing the classification
		threshold.
	*   **Initial Bias Setting:** For neural networks, setting the
		output layer's initial bias to reflect the class imbalance
		(calculated as $b_0 = \ln(pos/neg)$) can help with initial
		convergence by giving more reasonable initial guesses and
		reducing the initial loss significantly, preventing the model
		from spending the first few epochs learning that positive
		examples are unlikely.
*   **Designing the Cost Function:** Design a cost function that
	**penalizes wrong classification of the rare class more** than
	wrong classifications of the abundant class. For instance, an SVM
	can be tweaked to penalize wrong classifications of the rare class
	by the same ratio that this class is underrepresented.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** Use classifiers that internally manage
	imbalance, such as **XGBoost**, which takes care that the training
	bags are not overly imbalanced (though this is essentially hidden
	resampling).

## How critical is it to consider?

This is a crucial question, as dealing with class imbalance is not merely a technical prerequisite but a strategic choice guided by the underlying **cost structure** and **objectives of the specific application**.

While mitigation techniques like resampling and class weighting are generally recommended because most machine learning algorithms do not work well with imbalanced datasets, there are specific circumstances where accounting for the difference might be unnecessary or even counterproductive, depending on the desired outcome:

### 1. When the Costs of Misclassification are Implicitly Equal

Standard machine learning models often use a default classification threshold (e.g., $t=50\%$) when translating a probabilistic prediction into a deterministic class label. This default setting implicitly corresponds to assuming **equal costs of false negatives and false positives**.

If, in a rare scenario, the business or scientific requirement dictates that missing a rare event (False Negative) is truly as costly as incorrectly flagging a common event (False Positive), then aggressively modifying the dataset (via resampling) or the loss function (via heavy weighting) to prioritize the rare class might be inappropriate. In this case, the baseline model might correctly reflect the required trade-off, although evaluation should still rely on specialized metrics rather than accuracy.

### 2. When the Trade-Off Favors Precision on the Majority Class

In many real-world applications of imbalanced data, the primary decision is managing the **trade-off between precision and recall**.

If the **cost of a False Positive (FP)** (misclassifying a true negative as the rare positive class) is extremely high, a user might deliberately choose an approach that accepts a lower identification rate of the rare class (lower recall) to ensure a high rate of correctness when a positive classification is made (high precision).

Examples illustrating this conflict where mitigating the difference may be detrimental:

*   **User Happiness vs. Financial Loss:** In fraud detection, a **false negative** (a fraudulent transaction is missed) has a financial cost. However, a **false positive** (a legitimate transaction is incorrectly flagged as fraudulent) may **decrease user happiness** or lead to customer inconvenience (e.g., sending an email to verify a legitimate card activity). If avoiding customer friction is paramount, the model might be set to be highly conservative (high precision), even if that means missing some fraud (lower recall).
*   **Weighted vs. Baseline Models:** Comparing a class-weighted model against a baseline model (which did not use class weights) showed that the weighted model had lower accuracy and precision due to more false positives, but higher recall. If the objective were strongly skewed toward minimizing false positives, the baseline model could potentially be judged superior despite the imbalance, depending on the application's context.

In summary, the decision to account for the class difference depends entirely on the context of your problem and the desired **trade-offs between different types of errors**. While ignoring the difference might yield high overall accuracy, accuracy is not a helpful metric for imbalanced tasks. Therefore, even if complex balancing methods are avoided, focusing on appropriate metrics like **Precision, Recall, AUC, and AUPRC** is critical to evaluate if the difference needs to be accounted for.
